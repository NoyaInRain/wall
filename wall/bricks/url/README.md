Dropbox for Wall
================

To set up a dropbox, create a section "url" in your configuration file with the
following values:

 * title: a title for the dropbox
 * auth_code: Dropbox authorization code. Get it by visiting
   https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=kuyowpo8hdmu4ks
   and granting the Wall Project app access to the dropbox.
